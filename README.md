A utility library to write microservices in Clojure. The library provides some components that can be used with the
[component lifecycle framework](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component).

Friboo encourages the Swagger API-first approach where the REST API is defined as YAML.
See the [swagger1st library](https://github.com/sarnowski/swagger1st).

## Usage

Dependency:

    [org.zalando.stups/friboo <latest version>]

from Maven central.

Most simple case:

```clojure
(ns examples
  (:require [org.zalando.stups.friboo.system :as system]
            [com.stuartsierra.component :as component])
  (:gen-class))

(defn -main [&args]
  (let [configuration (system/load-configuration)
        system (component/new-system
          ; your system setup, see https://github.com/stuartsierra/component
          )]
    (system/run configuration)))
```

### Configuration options

* `:system-log-level` can be used to set the root logger to something different than `INFO`.

## Helpful components

Friboo mainly provides some helpful utilities which are mostly presented as components.

### HTTP component

The HTTP component is generated on demand by the `def-http-component` macro. You can define which dependencies your
API functions require.

```clojure
(ns myapi
  (:require [org.zalando.stups.friboo.system.http :refer [def-http-component]))

(def-http-component MyAPI "my-api.yaml" [db scheduler])

(defn my-api-function [parameters request db scheduler]
  ; your implementation that can use 'db' as well as 'scheduler' dependencies
  )
```

The first argument of your function will always be a flattened map (parameter name -> parameter value) without `in`
categorisation. This does violate the swagger spec which calls parameter names only unique in combination with your
`in` type. You have to take care during modelling your API.

#### Configuration options

The component has to be initialized with its configuration in the `:configuration` key.

    (map->MyAPI {:configuration {:port        8080
                                 :cors-origin "*.zalando.de"}})

* `:cors-origin` may be set to a domain mask for CORS access (e.g. `*.zalando.de`).
* All configurations that Jetty supports.
* All modifying requests (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) will be logged to the `:audit-logs-bucket`, if the property is set.
    * the value should address the name of an S3 bucket
    * the application must have write access to this bucket
    * the frequency, with which the log files are written, can be adjusted with `:audit-flush-millis` (defaults to 10s)
        * of course, no empty files will be written
    * to build a meaningful file name pattern, the environment variables `APPLICATION_ID`, `APPLICATION_VERSION`
      and `INSTANCE_ID` are used
        * `INSTANCE_ID` defaults to random UUID

### DB component

The DB component is generated on demand by the `def-db-component` macro. The DB component is itself a `db-spec`
compliant data structure, backed by a connection pool.

```clojure
(ns mydb
  (:require [org.zalando.stups.friboo.system.db :refer [def-db-component]))

(def-db-component MyDB)
```

#### Configuration options

The component has to be initialized with its configuration in the `:configuration` key.

    (map->MyDB {:configuration {:subprotocol "postgresql"
                                :subname     "localhost/mydb"}})

TODO link to jdbc documentation, pool specific configuration like min- and max-pool-size

## Real-world usage

There are multiple examples of real-world usages among the STUPS components:

* [Kio application registry](https://github.com/zalando-stups/kio) (REST service with DB)
* [Pier One Docker registry](https://github.com/zalando-stups/pierone) (REST service with DB and S3 backend)
* [Even SSH access granting service](https://github.com/zalando-stups/even) (REST service with DB)
* [Hello world example](https://github.com/hjacobs/friboo-hello-world) (very simple REST service without DB)

TODO HINT: set java.util.logging.manager= org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager to have proper JUL logging
