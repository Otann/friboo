# friboo

A utility library to write microservices in Clojure. The library provides some components that can be used with the
[component lifecycle framework](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component).

## Usage

Most simple case:

```clojure
(ns examples
  (:require [org.zalando.friboo.system :as system])
  (:gen-class))

(defn -main [&args]
  (let [configuration (system/load-configuration)]
    (system/run configuration)))
```

### Configuration options

* `:http-definition` has to point to a Swagger 2.0 YAML file in the classpath (see
  [swagger1st](https://github.com/sarnowski/swagger1st))
* `:http-cors-origin` may be set to a domain mask for CORS access (e.g. `*.zalando.de`).
* All configurations that Jetty supports prefix with 'http-' like 'http-port'.

## Real-world usage

If you want to leverage the component framework correctly, the simple use case above won't help you as you don't get
any dependencies into your API functions.

TODO provide example application; demonstrate the API protocol

TODO HINT: set java.util.logging.manager= org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager to have proper JUL logging
